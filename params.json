Asked to choose between Heart Health, Advertising, and Financial data, I choose to work on the former. Within the last year, heart health became part of my personal family health history and I jumped at the opportunity to gleam some insights.\r\n\r\nAfter initial exploration into the health dataset and into the significance (in terms of health) of certain markers/measurements in the dataset, I became dissatified because of a dearth of female patient data and very limited temporal information. I ventured into the web looking for alternate sources and found a sample of longitudial patient information from the [Framingham Heart Study](https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/). I built a MySQL database on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/ \"Digital Ocean\") cloud server to store the data.\r\n\r\n![Framingham](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9892419/7461542/0e2882cc-f279-11e4-9207-1e04fe765951.png)\r\n![longitudinal study](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9892419/7461435/5cb3913a-f278-11e4-91f0-68c6bd01d4f7.jpg)\r\n\r\nTo handle longitudinal data, I read research papers on Discrete Time Survival Analysis by Willet / Singer (1993). Replicating the methodolgy, I ran discrete person-time logistic models to identify risk factors for heart health related life events and demonstrate how hazard effect size varies over time and by gender. There was a significant level of data cleaning / preprocessing for analysis. And I created an interactive D3 tool to allow users to explore how effect size changes over time and varies by condition and gender.\r\n\r\n![D3 Interactive](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9892419/7504830/34744526-f41b-11e4-9e38-bf8089859cd3.gif)\r\n\r\n![ThisIsMetis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9892419/7356548/e1a3b3ac-ecf6-11e4-8fb6-be39f563742e.jpg) \r\n##Other Metis Projects:\r\n\r\n[Benson](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Benson/ \"Exploring MTA Data\") - Exploring MTA Data\r\n\r\n[Luther](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Luther/ \"Exploring Movie Data\") - Exploring Movie Data\r\n\r\n[Fletcher](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Fletcher/ \"Exploring Data with NLP\") - Exploring Data with NLP\r\n\r\n[Kojak](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Kojak/ \"Exploring NYC's Moving Populations\") - Exploring NYC's Moving Populations\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
